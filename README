Battleship
Programming Paradigms Final Project


For our project, we decided to program our own version of the classic game Battleship.
The rules of the game are that each player places his/her 4 ships on his half of the
board and then attempts to shoot the other player's ships. The opposing player's ships
are unseen, and all you know is whether an attempt was a hit or a miss. The first player
to sink all of the other players ships, wins.


How to run the code:

1. ssh into student02.cse.nd.edu and run the server code with the command: python server.py
2. connect to the server with player1 from any computer with the command: python player1.py
3. connect to the server with player2 from any computer with the command: python player2.py


How to play the game:

Once both players are connected, both players should place their ships on the bottom half of 
the screen. Once both players have placed their ships, player1 will go first. The players
then take turns clicking in the top half of the screen attempting to sink the other player's
ships. Once one player has sunk all ships, the game will end automatically.
